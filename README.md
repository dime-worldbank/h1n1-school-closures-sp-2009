# h1n1-school-closures-sp-2009
In 2009, in the middle of H1N1 pandemic, 13 municipalities of SÃ£o Paulo/Brazil opted for extending the winter break. This analysis aims to evaluate the impact of this measure on student's performance. Our treatment group are the schools of the municipalities that postponed the return to school; and the comparison group are the schools of the municipalities that did not change their school calendar. 

Unit of observation: schools. 
Source of the data: Prova Brasil and School Census. 
Period: 2005, 2007 (pre-treatment) and 2009 (post-treatment). 
Dependent variables: proficiency of students in portuguese and math.
Independent variables: the vector of control variables was chosen based on a Lasso regression, which selects the variables that better predict the variation in the proficiency score. The selected variables are: if the school has science and computer lab, sport court, library and access to the internet; instruction hours per day; students per class; approval rates; GDP per capita of the municipality where the school is located; and socioeconomic characteristics of fifth graders. The vector of socioeconomic variables include: percentage of mothers with a high school diploma; the percentage of students that already repeated or dropped out school; percentage of whites and girls; percentage of students that already work, that previously studied in a private school and that have a computer at home; percentage of students whose parent's incentive them to study, to do the homework, to read, to do not miss classes, and that talk about what happens in the school.
